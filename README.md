# Curvetopia-Adobe-Hackathon

This project delves into the art of recognizing, refining, and perfecting various 2D curves in Euclidean space, with a special focus on closed forms, symmetrical beauty, and the art of curve completion.

## Objective
Curvetopia-Adobe aims to craft an all-encompassing method for discovering, standardizing, and enhancing curves, beginning with basic shapes and advancing to intricate forms. This initiative focuses on curves represented by cubic BÃ©zier curves and polylines, with the results displayed in SVG format.

## Regularization
Focuses on regularizing the curves anything hand drawn to a normal regularized curve.

## Shape Classification
Focuses on classifying shapes based on their contours using OpenCV. It can distinguish between lines, triangles, rectangles, circles, and other polygons using geometric properties like aspect ratio and circularity.

## Symmetry
Provides tools for preprocessing images and identifying contours to analyze shape symmetry. The preprocessing involves converting images to binary format, and contours are extracted using OpenCV.

## Complete Incomplete curves
Demonstrates the use of KMeans clustering and TensorFlow models for analyzing and clustering path data. Includes functions to read data from CSV files and visualize paths using Matplotlib.
