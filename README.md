Welcome to **Curvetopia-Adobe**, where we embark on a quest to bring clarity and elegance to the realm of 2D curves. This project delves into the art of recognizing, refining, and perfecting various 2D curves in Euclidean space, with a special focus on closed forms, symmetrical beauty, and the art of curve completion.

## Objective
Curvetopia-Adobe aims to craft an all-encompassing method for discovering, standardizing, and enhancing curves, beginning with basic shapes and advancing to intricate forms. This initiative focuses on curves represented by cubic BÃ©zier curves and polylines, with the results displayed in SVG format.
